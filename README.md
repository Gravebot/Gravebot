A fantastic, helpful, and fun [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) chat bot! Gravebot comes with a bunch of cool and powerful commands for both Discord and games!

## [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## How to use
#### Invitation
The easiest way to set this bot up on your server is to invite it to your Discord server, It is currently hosted 24/7 and will always get the newest features first.

In order to do that, just [click here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=170664340968570880&scope=bot&permissions=268561430) and choose a server. You need to have **Manage Server** permission on that server. You may remove some of the permissions if you wish, but be warned it may break current and upcoming features.

If you want to give the bot a first try, you may do that in the [Gravebot's Lair](https://discord.gg/0iXEgtjdHgkpdsVr) Discord server.

If you have any questions, feedback or want to request features, you may also do that by leaving a message in [Gravebot's Lair](https://discord.gg/0iXEgtjdHgkpdsVr), private messaging Gravestorm or Zalik, as well as opening an [issue on Github](https://github.com/Gravebot/Gravebot/issues/new).

## Local Configuration

Rename `config.js.example` to `config.js` and fill in the required information. Note only variables with the `*Required*` comment are needed, everything else is optional.

## Local Installation
#### Windows:
**Warning**: Windows may have issues, even if all steps are done, sadly, we are not able to find the right dependencies for it (mostly regarding League of Legends and Wolfram commands), if you are familiar with coding, you can try messing around, either finding the right dependencies, or disabling the commands. If you are not familiar with coding, I would advise you to try out Linux, just install it alongside Windows and give it like 20GB of space, it will be plenty, and you will have a good experience. Feel free to ask for help regarding installation in Gravebot's Lair, just keep this in mind.

- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v4.0 or higher
- Install [python v2.7.3](https://www.python.org) ([32 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.msi), [64 bit](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.3/python-2.7.3.amd64.msi))
- Install [Microsoft Visual Studio C++ Express](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9816758)
- Install [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) (open the [command prompt](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/command-prompt-faq) and write `npm install -g node-gyp`)
- Install [redis](http://redis.io/download)
- Install [libxml2](https://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html) and add it to your PATH (note that this may not work and some extra tinkering may be needed, if you find a better way of installing it, please share it)
- If you are unable to install it, you may remove the wolfram-alpha dependency from package.json, and remove wolfram.js in the lib folder. That is the only command that uses libxml2.
- Run `npm-install.bat` to install the Node dependencies
- Run `launch.bat` to start the bot

#### Linux:
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v4.0 or higher

- Install [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) (open the [terminal](http://www.howtogeek.com/140679/beginner-geek-how-to-start-using-the-linux-terminal/) and write `sudo npm install -g node-gyp`)
- Install [redis](http://redis.io/download)
